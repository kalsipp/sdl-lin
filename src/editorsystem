Ability to quickly add and remove gameobjects from scene. Ability to modify parameters in gameobject. 

With no game object selected the scene just animates 
If a gameobject is clicked on it sticks to the mouse and may be moved around
If the mouse clicks again the gameobject followung the mouse gets placed. 
If i press 1-9 this places the gameobject as if I clicked. Then a new gameobject of type (1 = staticobject, 2 = npc, 3 = player) and gets attached to the mouse. 
If I press delete whilst a gameobject is selected it gets removed. 

If I press e whilst a gameobject is selected it brings up an editor menu. 
If I had a gameobject in hand it stops following my mouse. 
This menu has a row for each modifyable parameter in each object. 
Scale, Spritesheet, eventscript. 
It depends on which gameobject it is. If the item does not have an interactioncomponent then it will not query for eventscript. 
Each editor row will show the current value for the gameobject.
The cursor will be placed at the end of the text of the first entry. 
If I then type I will modify the text in place. I may not move the cursor, just delete and add text. 

If I press enter I will move to the next field. If I press tab I will move to the previous field. 
If I press enter in the last field I will be finished. This will exit edit mode.
If I press esc whenever this will exit edit mode. 

If I press a gameobject whilst in edit mode I will drop the gameobject I had on the ground. The new gameobject will become my held object. The fields gets modified to accomodate that gameobject. The cursor will be moved to the first field.
